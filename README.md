# Do you know ... Java?

The repository is based on my experiences that I gained during interviews, giving lectures, and practices.  
Also inspired by *Joshua Bloch, Neal Gafter - Java Puzzlers*.

Posts can be found on my blog https://torokmark.github.io/ where I detail the reasons of the phenomenons.

If you are aware of any glitches, tricks, or unexpected behaviour of Java language, make a PR.
